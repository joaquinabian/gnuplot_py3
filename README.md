## Fork of Gnuplot.py

This was forked from Michael Haggerty's [Gnuplot.py] at Sourceforge.  
Gnuplot.py has not been in development for a while and required a few changes to be ported to Python 3

## Installation

I just copied the folder into my modules folder.  
I am not using the tools for installation of the original repo which probably require some changes.

The package can be tested using the  *demo.py* and *test.py* scripts.

Tested on Python 3.8.
